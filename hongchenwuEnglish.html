    <p>Dr. <strong>Hongchen Wu</strong> is currently an associate professor in the School of Information Science and Engineering at Shandong Normal University. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from Shandong University in June 2016, and from September 2013 to September 2015, he was a joint Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine.</p>
    <p>Dr. <strong>Hongchen Wu</strong>'s research lies in the areas of next-generation internet and information security, big data computing based on deep learning, and interdisciplinary artificial intelligence research, including fake news detection, multimodal fake content (text, image, voice) recognition, personalized recommendation, privacy protection, computer-assisted education, and behavioral analysis. He is a member of the China Computer Federation (CCF) and a committee member of the CCF Service Computing Technical Committee. He serves as a reviewer for core computer science journals such as the Journal of Network and Computer Applications, IEEE Transactions (Cybernetics, MM, SC, EC, NNLS), Information Sciences, Expert Systems with Applications, and Neurocomputing, as well as interdisciplinary journals including Computers & Education, Computers in Human Behavior, and Multivariant Behavior Research.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>PI: National Natural Science Foundation of China</h3>
    <p><strong>Research on User Experience Based Cross-Domain Recommendation and Privacy Disclosure Pattern Mining</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Project Dates:</strong> January 2017 - present</p>
    <p><strong>Research Areas:</strong> domain specific prediction technology; user experience; cross-domain recommendation; privacy disclosure behavior; factor analysis</p>
    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> This research is focusing on user datasets from the cross-domain recommendation, whose characters are “enormous, scattered and fragmented”, and analyses the sensitiveness association between users’ trust to different websites and their personal traits. A cross-sites user service agent will be designed, and the machine learning techniques are modified for recognizing users’ privacy disclosure differences and for clustering them into groups. The privacy default settings are applied to raise users’ initial willingness of disclosure, and the Decider collector is constructed for making the privacy integration strategy, which would track users’ trust fluctuation as well as their feedbacks in privacy disclosure, and thus could gain users’ trust and raise users’ disclosure amount. The confirmatory factor analysis is applied to construct the users’ behavioral model which is consist of the correlations between the trust values and the personal traits of disclosure, and the privacy protection and collection strategies are determined for fitting users’ disclosure behavior model under the cross-domain recommendation hierarchy in the process of model optimization.</p>

    <h3>PI: Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China</h3>
    <p><strong>Research on Privacy Management Theory and Methods for Cross Platform Users</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Project Dates:</strong> July 2017 - present</p>
    <p><strong>Research Areas:</strong> Privacy management; Cross platform users; Differences in user behavior; Factor analysis method; Personalized service</p>
    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> This study focuses on the characteristics of "diverse, scattered, and multifactorial" cross platform user data. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the weight correlation between cross platform users' trust in different platforms and their own psychological characteristics. The optimal sharing parameters are studied, and a hierarchical experience mathematical model is constructed to demonstrate the mechanism of emotional contagion. Test the differences in user behavior before and after privacy collection, analyze the trend of emotional peaks, construct privacy sharing feature parameters and gradient characteristics, ensure high trust while effectively protecting users' privacy sharing volume. Based on confirmatory factor analysis, develop a leverage mechanism for potential risks and personalized service quality improvement, and study the dynamic interest trajectory and pros and cons strategies of cross platform users. Summarize the joint analysis method of cross platform data, optimize the hierarchical structure, and establish the best management system for collecting user privacy sharing.</p>

    <h3>PI: Key Research and Development Plan of Shandong Province of China</h3>
    <p><strong>Research on Key Technologies of Online Payment Fraud Identification Based on Internet User Behavior Authentication</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Project Dates:</strong> January 2019 - present</p>
    <p><strong>Research Areas:</strong> New generation information technology, big data technology</p>
    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> With the rapid development of the new generation of information technology and the Internet, users pay online to obtain fast and convenient e-commerce settlement services, but also increase concerns about security. This study is based on user behavior authentication in the big data environment, and constructs a pattern recognition mechanism for online payment fraud risk. By confirming the core event nodes in the payment process, we can predict the potential payment objects and default transaction entries of users, track the entire chain track process of users' payment, extract the characteristics and emotional fluctuations of fraudulent users by correlation analysis, predict the probability of transaction fraud, and solve the security guarantee problem of dynamic risks in the Internet.</p>
